# stock_prediction
The main objective of this project is to find the best model to predict the future stock market value (for next 20 days) from historical data for a particular company (ex: Google). This project will demonstrate how to “tune” the model will affect the results. The experimental results demonstrate that traditional ML algorithms may have a better performance.
